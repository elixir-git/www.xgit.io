Hi, I'm [Eric](https://ericscouten.com).

Thank you for your interest in this project.

I'm building Xgit because I want to explore the concept of _social data_. This is much like [GitHub](https://github.com)'s notion of social _coding,_ but I think it can apply far more broadly than coding in particular.

I think git is an interesting foundation for a social data platform. There are great libraries for mobile and desktop platforms ([libgit2](https://libgit2.org/) and [jgit](https://www.eclipse.org/jgit/)), and – while Java can be used for server products – I've been building server software in Elixir for the last few years and I personally prefer it to the Java world.
