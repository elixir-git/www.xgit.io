[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/05a6a392-f535-4e15-870e-7e14a2867ee3/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/vigilant-chandrasekhar-0a8a17/deploys)

This site is the source code for the Xgit project's [public blog](https://xgit.io) (or _reflog_, as we sometimes call it).

It is built using the following tools:

* [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
* [So Simple theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/so-simple-theme/) by [Michael Rose](https://mademistakes.com/)
* [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) hosting
